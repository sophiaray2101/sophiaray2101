## Projects

* Compiler

  * Source code in C++
  * Fully functioning compiler for a C like language with 5 stages: lexing, parsing, lowering, codegen, and optimization
  * Takes in the code in the "C flat" language and will compile optimally
 
* Ball Collision Simulation

  * Coded in python, animations created using matplotlib
  * Animates a pool table with two balls and simulates the collisions between the balls and the walls
  * It can simulate any different starting positions and velocities
  * Uses the laws of physics and motion to update the animation in each frame and considers dampening/friction forces when colliding with the walls
